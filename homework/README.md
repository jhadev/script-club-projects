## Session 1

1. Write a program to declare variables of different [data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures).
2. Perform basic arithmetic functions (e.g., calculate the total and average of three numbers).
3. Log results to the console and experiment with different outputs.

## Session 2

1. Use a [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator) to classify a number as "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero".
2. Use a [for ... of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop to print the first 10 even numbers (2, 4, ..., 20) from an array.
   
  **BONUS** - Create an object with 3 properties (e.g., product details) and use [for ... in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop to log each property and value.

## Session 3

1. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their product.
2. Create an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to check if a string is longer than 5 characters.
3. Use [try ... catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) to handle an invalid input scneario (e.g., non-numeric input).
   
## Session 4

1. Create an array of 5 numbers and write a function to calculate their sum using [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce).
2. Use [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to create a new array with each number squared.
3. [Filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) the array to include only numbers greater than 10.
